# n8n Repository Assets

**Important:** Workflow JSON files are managed privately in n8n Cloud/Server and should not be committed here.

- Keep `n8n/workflows/` empty (only this README and a placeholder).
- Add human-readable documentation under `docs/workflows/` when required.
- If you need to restore a workflow locally, import it into n8n rather than storing the JSON in git.
